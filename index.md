# **About Me**
üåê [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristianbmj/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/cristianBMJ) | [Class of Physics](https://www.classgap.com/es-cl/tutor/cris-martinez)
 
Physicist with a specialization in Data Science and Data Analytics.

# *Apps* 


### [*Task Tracker App*](https://task-tracker-app.streamlit.app/) 
*Streamlit*

A lightweight web application to track and analyze daily habits and progress.

Check out and use it üòâ [HERE](https://task-tracker-app.streamlit.app/) (version beta)

# *Machine Learning Engineer*

### [*MLops Turbine Energy*](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/mlops-turbine-energy)  
*MLops | MLflow | flask API | Streamlit*  
Machine Learning model to predict Turbine Energy Yield (TEY) based on operational data. It features an interactive Streamlit and an API that serves the best-performing model tracked in MLflow.


### [*Recommender System*](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/Recommendation_System_MLflow)  
*MLops | MLflow | Streamlit*  
Developed a recommender system using filtering techniques on Amazon‚Äôs dataset. Experiments managed with MLflow and a web app built in Streamlit for user interaction.  

### [*ETL Process*](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/Process_ETL)  
*BigQuery | Airflow | Testing*  
Implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from a API, transform it, and load it into BigQuery using Airflow. Incorporated Agile methodologies, testing, and version control.

## [*E-commerce Purchasing Patterns Analysis*](https://github.com/cristianBMJ/Data_Analysis_Projects/blob/main/analyzing-purchasing-patterns.ipynb)

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce data to uncover customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and product trends. Using a dataset of 2.7M events, including views, add-to-carts, and transactions, it provides insights to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.

Dataset Highlights

- Events: 2.66M views, 69K add-to-carts, 22K transactions.
- Users: 1.4M unique visitors.
- Products: 417K unique items.
- The analysis focuses on identifying anomalies, popular products, and customer journeys to support decision-making in e-commerce operations.
