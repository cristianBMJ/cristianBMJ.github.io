# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Cristian MartÃ­nez  

I am a physicist with a specialization in Data Science and Engineering. My expertise lies in developing and deploying machine learning and deep learning models, including forecasting, clustering, classification, and regression, to solve complex real-world problems.  

In the MLOps domain, I implemented recommendation systems using MLflow and built interactive web applications with Streamlit to enable model experimentation. My experience also includes designing and automating ETL pipelines with Airflow, integrating data into BigQuery, and ensuring code reliability with unit testing (Pytest).  

As a data analyst, I have explored global commodities trading, conducting trade balance evaluations for various countries. I am proficient in Python, C++, and R, with hands-on experience in tools like Git, Docker, Linux, and Emacs. Additionally, I excel in data visualization, utilizing libraries such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, along with platforms like Tableau and Looker.  

ðŸš€ Check out my [projects and contributions](https://github.com/cristianBMJ)!

# Projects  

### 1. **Recommender System**  
*MLops | MLflow | Streamlit*  
Developed a recommender system using filtering techniques on Amazonâ€™s dataset. Experiments managed with MLflow and a web app built in Streamlit for user interaction.  

### 2. **ETL Process**  
*BigQuery | Airflow | Testing*  
Implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from a fake API, transform it, and load it into BigQuery using Airflow. Incorporated Agile methodologies, testing, and version control.  

### 3. **Product Sales Projection**  
*Machine Learning | Time Series | LightGBM*  
Developed a sales prediction model, achieving a 6% accuracy improvement, enhancing inventory planning for an agricultural company.  

### 4. **Forecasting Store Sales of Drinks**  
*Machine Learning | Time Series*  
Predicted daily beverage sales for February 2022 using a RandomForestRegressor, improving RMSE by 11.3%.  

### 5. **Discovering Exoplanets**  
*Machine Learning*  
Classified exoplanets using Random Forest and hyperparameter tuning, achieving an F1 score of 74.65%.  

### 6. **Classification of Flowers**  
*Deep Learning | Pretrained | TPU*  
Built a flower image classification model using pretrained models (Xception, VGG16, DenseNet201) and TPU hardware.
