# Projects  

### **Recommender System**  
*MLops | MLflow | Streamlit*  
Developed a recommender system using filtering techniques on Amazon’s dataset. Experiments managed with MLflow and a web app built in Streamlit for user interaction.  

### **ETL Process**  
*BigQuery | Airflow | Testing*  
Implemented an ETL pipeline to extract data from a fake API, transform it, and load it into BigQuery using Airflow. Incorporated Agile methodologies, testing, and version control.  

### **Product Sales Projection**  
*Machine Learning | Time Series | LightGBM*  
Developed a sales prediction model, achieving a 6% accuracy improvement, enhancing inventory planning for an agricultural company.  

### **Forecasting Store Sales of Drinks**  
*Machine Learning | Time Series*  
Predicted daily beverage sales for February 2022 using a RandomForestRegressor, improving RMSE by 11.3%.
